        This project visualizes time in a unique and interactive way. Time is represented as a percentage of the day that has passed, dynamically updating as the day progresses. The background color shifts gradually throughout the day, creating a subtle visual gradient that reflects the passage of time. The project offers a creative interpretation of time, blending numerical precision with aesthetic changes to enhance user engagement.
