        This project is an interactive animation where a square exhibits emotions as you interact with it. When you hover your mouse over the square, it "feels happy," changing its color to a bright, cheerful shade and even smiling! When you move your mouse away, the square "feels sad," turning to a duller shade and losing its smile. Meanwhile, the square bounces around the canvas, creating a dynamic and playful interaction that visually represents how our attention can influence emotions..
